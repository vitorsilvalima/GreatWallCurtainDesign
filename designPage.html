						<h2> The designer</h2>
						<p>
							Queeney, who was horned on January 4th, 1974, finished her high school study 
							when she was 17 years old. During her high school study, she found two part-time jobs.
							The first one was tutoring, which helped her learn how to communicate well with people.
							Next, she worked as bookkeeper in an accounting company. " I learnt how to analyze marketing
							trend from keeping account" my mom said. Those two jobs helped her business in the future.
							She started her own business when she was 21 years old. At first, she focused on selling bedding stuff and curtain. 
							At that time, she noticed that it was hard to design some special style for beddings, but could design some fashionable curtains.
							 Therefore, she bought some fashion and jewelry magazine to get some good ideas for designing. In 2014, a exhibition about curtain 
							 designing invited  Queeney to participate in this great event and showed some designing. As a result, she won bronze medal from the 
							 competition.
